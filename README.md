# Photo Gallery Original #

This was a tutorial project that was an introduction into more advanced OOP practices in PHP by Lynda.com.

The first time I sat down to work on this tutorial around 2005, I didn't really know that much about object oriented programming and was just learning PHP. 

This tutorial taught me a lot at the time.

Now, when I want to learn a new framework, I usually pull out this tutorial and build a new version with that framework in mind.

Each time I re-build it I try to improve it a little more. Looking at the other versions, you can see a clear evolution from the original, and whatever the newest incarnation of it is. I try to keep the orignal aesthetics as much as possible. The real changes occur on the back end.

Other versions can be found here:
- [FuelPHP version](https://github.com/casperwilkes/photo_gallery_new) 
- [Laravel version](https://github.com/casperwilkes/photo_gallery_lara)

## What is Photo Gallery? ##

The Photo Gallery is an extremely simplified photo uploading application. The original purpose of the project was to teach  programmers several key features most applications will want:

* Upload files
* Create a login / logout system
* Create log files
* Read from files
* Write to files
* CRUD interaction with databases

## Setup ##
I have included a sql file of the original database's structure and the original images that came with the tutorial's project files. These can be found in the setup directory. There is a readme.txt in there that should be able to help get you started.

# NOTE: #
This is an **extremely old** application. It could be used to start discovering PHP and OOP principals, but should absolutely **NEVER** be put into a production environment. A lot of this is out-dated, and most of it would be considered security risks at this point. 

Use at your own discretion.
